# angular-gulp-starter
This is an angular project starting point I put together for me to use after going through John Papa's Pluralsight course [JavaScript Build Automation With Gulp.js](http://www.pluralsight.com/courses/javascript-build-automation-gulpjs).
Forked from [John Papa's pluralsight-gulp](https://github.com/johnpapa/pluralsight-gulp) repo for the course and built out the rest of the project.


## Get Going
```bash
$ npm install
```
